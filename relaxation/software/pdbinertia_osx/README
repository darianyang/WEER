# README    pdbinertia

Assuming that you have the blas and lapack libraries
installed, you can just run 'make' to compile
the programs. 

The test input files are as follows:

1ubq.prot.pdb    ! ubiquitin crystal structure

ubq.inertia.output       ! pdbinertia results
1ubq.prot.inertia.pdb    ! output structure rotated to
                         ! inertia tensor principal axes

To test the pdbinertia program, run

pdbinertia -r 1ubq.prot.pdb 1ubq.prot.test.pdb  >ubq.test.out

When in doubt, read the .html documentation
