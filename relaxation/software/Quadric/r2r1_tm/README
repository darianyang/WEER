# README    r2r1

Assuming that you have the blas and lapack libraries
installed, you can just run 'make' to compile
the programs. 

All .html files should be placed in the same directory
(or you should fix the links)

The test input files are as follows:

ubq.in           ! control file for r2r_diffusion
ubq.r2r1.input   ! input R2/R1 file 
1ubq.prot.pdb    ! ubiquitin crystal structure
1ubq.trans.pdb   ! ubiquitin structure, translated to
                 ! center of mass using 'pdbinertia'

ubq.output       ! r2r1_diffusion results
1ubq.rot.pdb   ! output structure rotated to
                 ! axially symmetric principal axes

To test the r2r1 program, run

r2r1_diffusion ubq.in >ubq.r2r1.test.out

When in doubt, read the .html documentation
