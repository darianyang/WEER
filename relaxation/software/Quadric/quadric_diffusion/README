# README    quadric_diffusion

Assuming that you have the blas and lapack libraries
installed, you can just run 'make' to compile
the programs. 

All .html files should be placed in the same directory
(or you should fix the links)

The test input files are as follows:

ubq.in           ! control file for quadric_diffusion
ubq.tm.input     ! input tm file (obtained from 'r2r1_tm'
1ubq.prot.pdb    ! ubiquitin crystal structure
1ubq.trans.pdb   ! ubiquitin structure, translated to
                 ! center of mass using 'pdbinertia'

ubq.output       ! quadric_diffusion results
1ubq.axial.pdb   ! output structure rotated to
                 ! axially symmetric principal axes
1ubq.anis.pdb    ! output structure rotated to
                 ! anisotropic principal axes

input file for r2r1_tm program
ubq.r2r1.in        ! r2r1_tm control file
ubq.r2r1.input     ! input R2/R1 file 
ubq.tm.input       ! output from r2r1_tm

To test the quadric_diffusion program, run

quadric_diffusion ubq.in >ubq.quadric.test.out

To test the r2r1_tm program, run

r2r1_tm <ubq.r2r1.in >ubq.r2r1.test.out

When in doubt, read the .html documentation
